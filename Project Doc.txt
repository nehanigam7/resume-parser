Verify installation by running in the terminal:

node -v
npm -v

Step 2: Get the Project Code
Download or clone the project files.
In the terminal, go to the project folder

Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install dependencies by running this command in the terminal:

npm install

Step 4: Start the Server

Step 5: Upload Resumes and Get Parsed Data
Use Postman or curl to send a POST request to upload resumes:

The server will return parsed data in JSON format.
